# COSC490 Group Project
Final Project for RSA Alogirthm (Members: Niles Dobbs, Mardokai Hintsa, Touri Holmes)

# About the Project

For our Final Project, we decided to create an RSA Algorithm. The purpose of our code is to demonstrate the RSA Algorithm with 4-5 digit prime numbers using Python Programming.

Here's why:
  * Over the past few decades technology has advanced but there are still crucial flaws in its composition.
  * It is so important to protect the information that you do not want anyone else to see. 
  * This is why encryption has become such an important part of the privacy of a message during communication.
 
The utilization of prime numbers to encrypt messages is present in the Rivest–Shamir–Adleman
(RSA) algorithm. According to RSA.com, “RSA is here to help you manage your digital risk with a range
of capabilities and expertise including integrated risk management, threat detection and response, identity
and access management, and fraud prevention.” The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and convert
the RSA algorithm into a programming application in Excel. This project will allow us to understand the
oldest and most widely used public-key cryptosystem.

### Built With

The language we used to code the agorithm was Python. This is a common language used amongst all individuals with easy readability.
* [repl.it Project](https://replit.com/@TouriHolmes/Senior-Project#main.py)
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

### Getting Started

To use the code you will need a program that runs .py files.

### Running the Code

The code is ran based upon a Prime modulus from nmbers p and q. You will first be asked to input prime numbers for p and q, which if both numbers are confirmed True, would print out the modulus and eulerotient. You are then asked to input a number that has no common factors with the former two, as well as a name to encypt. Depending how large the numbers will depend on how long the code will take to encrypt/decrypt the inputted message.
